# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis (MySQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **retail sales data** using **MySQL**. The goal is to uncover insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product demand patterns. By leveraging SQL queries, we extract meaningful business intelligence that can guide decision-making in areas like inventory management, pricing, and marketing strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Store and manage retail sales data in MySQL.
* Perform SQL queries to analyze:

  * Total revenue and profit trends.
  * Best-selling products and categories.
  * Top-performing customers and regions.
  * Seasonal and monthly sales patterns.
* Generate actionable insights for business growth.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Database:** MySQL
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** SQL queries
* **Visualization (Optional):** Power BI / Excel / Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Dataset:** Retail sales transactions dataset (real-world or synthetic)

## 📊 Example SQL Queries

```sql
-- 1. Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM sales;

-- 2. Top 5 Best-Selling Products
SELECT product_name, SUM(sales_amount) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 3. Monthly Sales Trend
SELECT MONTH(order_date) AS month, SUM(sales_amount) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

## 📈 Key Insights (Sample)

* 📌 Electronics category contributed the highest revenue.
* 📌 December showed the peak sales due to holiday season.
* 📌 Top 10% of customers accounted for \~40% of total revenue.
* 📌 Some products had low turnover, suggesting overstocking issues.

Do you want me to also **write SQL queries for common business KPIs** (like revenue by region, repeat customers, profit margin, etc.) and include them in the README?
